# WeaveVM ðŸ§µâœ¨

**WeaveVM** is an experimental **virtual machine** that aims to be a simulator to run **Tapestry**[https://github.com/nmdis1999/Tapestry] on top of it.

This is part of [Code, Coffee, Talk](https://www.meetup.com/code-coffee-talk/?eventOrigin=your_groups) workshop project, and it is encouraged to fork or create your own VM.

## Aim

- **Living World** â€” The VM is a simulated world with entities, resources, and evolving rules.  
- **Execution Engine for Language-as-a-Game** â€” Weave will be the backbone to run **Tapestry**[https://github.com/nmdis1999/Tapestry].
